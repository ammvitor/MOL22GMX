MOL22GMX is a fast way to parametrize small molecules without the use of ambertools (mostly), in a fast ans simple way.
The main goal is to mimetize PDB2GMX for small molecules using GAFF2 Forcefield.
You just need your receptor gro, your ligand mol2 (with gaff naming)  and the topol.top file from pdb2gmx
Output are the complex gro, the atomtypes, the topology itp and the topology.top.new, a topology file with with the ligand topologies included. 
1-Instalation

Enter the src/ folder and 
make

the bin MOL22GMX will be created in ..

2 - How to use
Run MOL22GMX with the following flags:
-i Ligand MOL2 with gaff atomnames (do not work with sybil types)
-x The output name for the ligand residue i.e carbon.itp
-g The gro output of the ligand by itself
-p input name of the gro file of the receptor without the ligand
-c Output of the Complex gro (ligand+receptor)
-t topol.top file input. MOL22GMX will generate a topol.top.new with the include of the atomtype and itp for the ligands int he right ordem and the ligand name in the [molecules] area.

3- Database
gaff2.dat is the database for the parameters extracted from amber16, with the file structure modified for our use. Sometimes the program will not find the paramters for certain configuration of a molecule, so please, run parmchk from ambertools and add the parameters in the gaff2.dat
